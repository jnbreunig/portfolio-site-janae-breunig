                    <p>This is an UXUI case study for a one-stop recipe app.
                        For this project, I completed the entire UX process from
                        ideation and research to user personas and user testing.
                        Once I understood what my user was looking for, I started
                        the UI process by refining my wireframes and creating the
                        look/feel of the app and taking that through to mockups
                        and prototypes.</p>

                    <p>This is an UI case study to build an app to allow my user
                    to reach their specific savings goal. For this project I
                    completed the UI process from defining the objective and
                    guiding principles, to user flows and testing, to low, mid
                    and high wireframes.</p>
